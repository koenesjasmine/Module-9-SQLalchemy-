## Results
With this analysis from June and December the peak tempatures in Oahu, HI seem to be almost indistinguishable. 
* The maximum tempature in June is on two degrees higher than December; both months having comparably close maximum tempature points
* The average temperature is relatively close with June being three degrees higher than December
* The minimum tempature for December is about eight degrees lower than June
Overall the trends on temperature between June and December may have small deifference, however it is relatively small, and the ability to generate revenue based soley on temperature should be the same throughout the entirity of the year. To further elevate inquires, I would suggest an additional queury on rainfall throughout the year to determine how much outdoor activity is done to factor into overall profitability.
